The OpenSCAD Lego Imitation Block Generator is a customizable block generator that allows you to create your own Lego imitation blocks using the OpenSCAD programming language. The generator comes with several basic block shapes, and you can customize the size, shape, and features of the blocks to suit your needs.

## Installation

To use the OpenSCAD Lego Imitation Block Generator, you'll need to have [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) installed on your computer. Once you have OpenSCAD installed, simply clone or download the repository and open the `lego_block_generator.scad` file in OpenSCAD to get started.

## Usage

To generate a block, simply call the `block()` module and specify the shape and any customizations you want. Here's an example of how to create a basic block:

scssCopy code

`block();` 

This will create a block with the default dimensions of 40mm x 20mm x 10mm.

You can customize the dimensions of the block by passing in the `width`, `length`, and `height` parameters:

cssCopy code

`block(width=30, length=60, height=15);` 

You can also customize the shape of the block by passing in the `shape` parameter. The available shapes are:

-   `basic` (default): A basic Lego imitation block with no features.
-   `slant`: A block with slanted bumps on top and holes in the bottom.
-   `hole`: A block with holes in the bottom.
-   `bump`: A block with larger bumps on top.

Here's an example of how to create a slanted block:

scssCopy code

`block(shape="slant");`
